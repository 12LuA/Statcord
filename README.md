# DisStat
An in-progress project by TomatoCake and numselli, which aims to replace [Statcord](https://statcord.com) with a more stable and better updated alternative due to it being offline and/or really unstable recently.

## Main URL
https://statcord.com

## API/Using it

The easiest way to get started is using premade libraries, which can be found on the [guide page](https://statcord.com/guide).

Alternatively, you can use our [API docs](https://statcord.com/docs) to build your own wrapper.

## Support
If you need help (or want to help) with the site, you can join our [Discord ![](https://discord.com/api/guilds/1081089799324180490/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/qsHxVUnXqr) or [open an issue](https://github.com/statcord/DisStat/issues/new) on GitHub.
