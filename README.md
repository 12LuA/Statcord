# DisStat
A in-progress project by TomatoCake and numselli, which aims to replace [Statcord](https://statcord.com)
with a more stable alternative due to it being offline recently and not updated in a long time.

## Features
This allows bot owners to track usage and statistics of their bot, and allows users to view bot stats.
Statistics include guild, user, and shard counts, and can be expanded to track commands, events, and more.

You can find it's API docs [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/DisStat/DisStat/1.0.0).

## Support
If you need help (or want to help) with the site, you can join our [**Discord** ![](https://discord.com/api/guilds/1081089799324180490/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/qsHxVUnXqr)
or open an issue on GitHub.

## TODO/Ideas
- Auto fetch bot lists the bot is on and display them on /bot/:id/vote or similar for owners to link to
- Vote buckets like statcord has
- Custom graphs like statcord has
- Custom urls for bots
- npm and pypi packages
